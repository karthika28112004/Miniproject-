## Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Prediction
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. It's primarily caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most commonly from cigarette smoke.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Our COPD prediction project using an artificial neural network (ANN) involves training a model to recognize patterns in input data, such as medical metrics, that are associated with COPD. The ANN is designed to learn complex relationships in the data by adjusting weights through multiple layers of interconnected nodes

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Implements advance neural network method.
- Uses Python for model development 
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- Trains the model with new data, allowing for ongoing improvement in prediction accuracy and adaptability to various datasets.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Software and Libraries: Python programming language for implementing the project
* Dataset: Labeled dataset with patients data relevant to COPD
* Model Training and Evaluation Tools: Validation and testing tools to evaluate the ANN and object detection model's accuracy.
* Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or other IDEs that support Python and deep learning libraries.
* Internet Access: For downloading model weights, dataset, and dependencies from Google Drive (if integrated) and other sources.

Detection Accuracy: 97.5%
Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.


## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model would predict the likelihood of COPD in a given dataset. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine its effectiveness.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
